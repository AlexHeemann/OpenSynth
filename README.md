Open Synth is an open source wavetable synthesizer. It uses the [JUCE](https://www.juce.com) framework and can be compiled as VST/AU/standalone. 
The code is available under the GPL license.

Note that this is a super early release, and the project is under WIP.

I've got a long list of things I want to add and improve :)
